# Quality Assurance

Hello Everyone since July 2022 I have been working as a Quality Assurance Engineer in Cognizant for a Switzerland based client and have been associated with our product release for one of the largest county in North America and South America. Beside that I have also been trained in Modern Data Engineering including various ETL tools like Informatica, Abnitio and also been trained on SQL, Python during my Training Period in which I have a 90+ percentage in grades.

My team has got the client appreciation and I have also received appreciation letter from my Home Manager.

I would like to divide my experience in two parts:


**1. [Quality Assurance in the Backend/Data Engineering Part](/category/quality-assurance-for-backenddataengineering)**

**2. [Quality Assurance in the Frontend/Mashup UI Part](/category/quality-assurance-for-frontendmashup-ui)**
