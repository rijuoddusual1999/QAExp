# Agile Methodology

1. **Participation in Agile Teams**:
As a QA Engineer, I have had the privilege of being an integral part of Agile development teams. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, have been at the heart of our software development process.

2. **Scrum Calls and Daily Stand-ups**:
Within the Agile framework, I regularly attended Scrum calls and participated in daily stand-up meetings. These daily check-ins were vital for keeping everyone on the same page. During these meetings, I shared my progress, discussed any roadblocks, and collaborated with other team members to ensure that the sprint goals were being met.

3. **Working within Sprints**:
In an Agile environment, work is organized into sprints, which are typically 2-4 week cycles. As a QA Engineer, I played a crucial role in defining acceptance criteria, conducting testing, and ensuring that all user stories were complete by the end of each sprint. This involved thorough testing, bug reporting, and regression testing.

4. **Quality Assurance and Agile Principles**:
Throughout my tenure, I focused on ensuring the quality of the product by adhering to Agile principles such as customer collaboration through a team lead, responding to change, and delivering working software. This approach resulted in a more robust and user-friendly product.
