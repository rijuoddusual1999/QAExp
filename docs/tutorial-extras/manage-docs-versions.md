# Mashup UI & Qliksense Testing


1. I performed Mashup UI testing for the countries dashboard, focusing on UI and Data Errors.

2. All the data for KPIs in Mashup comes from QlikSense, and I ran multiple SQL scripts in Snowflake to test the data in QlikSense and then matched them in the UI.

3. I conducted testing in both QA and Dev environments.

4. I reported multiple data failures for the QlikSense data and MashUI data.
